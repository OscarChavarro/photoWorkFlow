# PHOTO WORKFLOW

Photo workflow is set of tools for helping professional photografers to
optimize their work flow:
- Client manager: quickly create a custom webpage for each customer, offering
  simple authentication methods as such instagram, google and facebook in order
  to avoid account creation while protecting customer images.
- Photo selector: allows customer to see the whole session image set and
  select favourites photos using a Tinder-like interaction.
- Photo classifier: allows photographers to sort large set of reference images
  for both studying and project preparation.
